## Instructions

Put the score into a folder named `songs`, and make sure that the notes in the midi file are in the center C and two octaves of white keys up and down.

Follow the prompts to enter the midi file name (not including the suffix, namely `.mid`) and the sleeping time (that is, wait a few seconds to start playing).
